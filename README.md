# Personalized Portfolio Website

This project is a github version of my personal portfolio website. My website's main page contains an about me section and a list of all of my projects. My project portfolio has a blurb which talks about the project and then connects to the deployment page if it is live. The nav bar links out to different parts of the main page and opens a new tab where you can download a version of my resume in PDF format. This page holds all of my commits and older versions of my personal website. 

## Deployed: ##

Currently the website is live and can be visited at:

This project is built with React.
