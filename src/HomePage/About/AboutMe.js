                <h2>TOO YOUNG TO SETTLE!</h2>
                <p>I originally started my work history in the restaurant industry. I learned very quickly that sometimes you have to go where you are needed. An industry where you have to fill a certain roll even if you aren't best suited for it. Through this I managed to pick up many different skills quickly. Unfortunately I could never find the intellectual spark necessary to keep me motivated. Because of this I began the more intellectual pursuit of pharmacy.</p>
                <p>I became familiar with pharmacy work pretty quickly, and continued to grow in the field becoming certified and starting a position at Vanderbilt after only a year. I then went on to be trained in sterile products and compounding but I found it just wasn't enough. It was more stimulating than my previous jobs but I wasn't satisfied enough and I began to plateau.</p>
                <p>I spoke to my supervisor at the time about trying to continue on and I will never forget her words "You've reached as far as you can go. Stop trying so hard, this is it." After that I decided I wasn't going to live my career in "good enough".</p>
                <p>As an avid gamer who is familiar with a computer I armed myself with my choices and fell in love with programming. I will never look back on my decision. I have found a future that will make me happy.</p>
